# WPF application
It is a great application which shows how to build MVVM architecture in WPF. I created model to show CRUD operations working with MSSQL database, built different providers as SerializationProvider and MSSQLProvider, used commands for working with buttons, created forms for object and GenericService for working as database repository.
